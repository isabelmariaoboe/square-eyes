My cross course project is a website for streaming videos made by independent filmmakers whose business model is based on a pay-per-view basis. The brand has two main types of target audience: content producers (those selling the films they have produced) and content consumers (those watching the videos that are being made).

## Description

- This was my cross project that I have been building up during this first year of studies.
- It's a dynamic, aesthetic and easy to use website.
- This was my first project using JavaScript.
- For the backend I used WordPress (WP) as a headless CMS.
- As mentioned above, there are 2 kinds of profiles thus 2 different login forms.
- The producers, in addition to watch movies, can upload their own works.
- There is a search page that when searching for a title makes an API call to the WP backend to retrive the results and display them in cards.
- The cards are clickable and once clicked over the chosen movie then it comes the payment page.
- once the payment is accepted thenthe player is displayed.
